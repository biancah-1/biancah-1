# Hey, I'm Bianca. 

### I enjoy learning new things, solving problems and being creative. 

🎓 I'm wrapping up my engineering degree, woo! Looking for my next adventure. </br>
💼 I have experience in hardware (layout) and medical research. </br>
🫀 I'm passionate about health care and its intersection with technology. </br>
🎨 I love creative endeavours; you may find me drawing, painting, crocheting, embroidering or playing music (namely ukulele or piano). </br>
📊 I'm weirdly into looking at data. </br>
🏋️‍♀️ I unwind at the gym, going for a run or climbing with friends.
